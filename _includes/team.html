                  <p class="education">
                  A three-month intensive program focused on backend development with Ruby on Rails. Rather than build a reliance on a particular language or framework, the program focused on giving students pragmatic programming fundamentals, ones that could be parlayed into new technologies and working environments. Independent research, application of new tools, and individual failure were all important parts of the learning process, which culminated in a three-week final project where students were left to their own devices to build a functioning application.
