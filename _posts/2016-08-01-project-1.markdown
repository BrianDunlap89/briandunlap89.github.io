My first foray into automation testing, this project involved writing automated acceptance tests for  a super simple dummy website. Watir and RSpec were the primary tools involved. I also threw in a couple of PORO page objects (not the gem) to remove the bulk of the logic from the test suite. The only snag I hit was in figuring out how to dynamically append the values of the `MONTHS` hash (located in the `MonthPage` class) to the base uri, and for each permutation run the entire test script. T'was very easily resolved, though, with the proper `context` and `before(:context)` blocks.
