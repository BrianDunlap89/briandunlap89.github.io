description: Wanderful lets users create and curate points of interest in their area, and use them to build personalized tours of their city. These tours are then available to the public, with the goal of empowering traveling visitors and locals alike to experience a city from a fresh perspective. Built with Rails, the API allowed the mobile and front-end teams to securely (using bcrypt) write and access data regarding users, tours, and sites, among other things. Photo and audio uploads were managed with Paperclip and stored on Amazon S3. The backend also supports several to-be-realized features, including site and tour ratings, reviews, and favorites. The Geocoder gem also allowed the team to aggregate tours and sites based on either coordinates or a street address. Performance tests were written with RSpec and tested using Factory Girl.
