description: Voyage was built as a travel-specific alternative to things like Facebook and Instagram, with the goal of eliminating social clutter and offering users a way to more clearly and beautifully document their travels. Users can create unique journeys, with the option to add descriptions, commentary, and images (uploads managed by Paperclip and stored with S3). Future versions of the project will allow users to share their journeys publically or make them accessible only to selected contacts.
