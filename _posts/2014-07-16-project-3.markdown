description: While not a particularly complicated or advanced project, tic tac toe was my first foray into object oriented design, and it marked my first important breakthrough as a programmer (epiphanies abound!). The t3 Redux was V1.1 of tic tac toe, and was the first time I was able to purposefully refactor something I'd built. It's a basic game that supports either two humans or a human and computer player, and it's executed via the terminal. Again, not a technical marvel, but a personal milestone that I value.
